# Blind UNION-based SQLi with Python

This code aims to address a problem of slowness of a free version of a well-known penetration testing tool Burp Suite. The issue of slowness arised in one of the labs presented by the Port Swigger Academy which didn't allow the task to be finished. Hence, I decided to write a Python script to workaround the limitations of the free Burp Suite software.
